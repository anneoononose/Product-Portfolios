# TaskFlow: Intelligent Productivity Platform

## Problem Statement
TaskFlow addresses three critical productivity challenges faced by modern teams:

1. **Fragmented Tools & Information**: Teams use an average of 4+ disconnected tools, wasting 5+ hours weekly switching contexts and hunting for information.

2. **Poor Visibility & Accountability**: Managers lack real-time project status without interrupting team members, while dependencies and bottlenecks remain hidden until causing delays.

3. **Inefficient Collaboration**: Asynchronous teamwork creates bottlenecks, document version control is inconsistent, and meeting overload compensates for poor async communication.

## Project Overview
This portfolio demonstrates my end-to-end product management process for TaskFlow, including user research, persona development, feature prioritization, and technical implementation.

## Key Deliverables

### [User Research & Personas](TaskFlow-UserResearch.pdf)
Comprehensive analysis of user needs and detailed persona profiles for Team Lead Taylor and Individual Contributor Alex.

### [Feature Prioritization](TaskFlow-FeaturePrioritization.pdf)
Strategic prioritization of features using impact vs. effort analysis to determine MVP and future phases.

### [Technical Implementation](https://github.com/anneoonoonose/Product-Portfolio/tree/main/TaskFlow-PM/Technical)
Working code samples demonstrating the intelligent task prioritization algorithm and API design.

### [Product Requirements Document](TaskFlow-PRD.pdf)
Detailed specifications for core features, user flows, and acceptance criteria.
