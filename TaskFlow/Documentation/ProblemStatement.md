# TaskFlow: Problem Statement & User Research

## Core Productivity Challenges

Teams today face three critical problems in their productivity workflows:

### 1. Fragmented Tools and Information
- Teams use an average of 4+ disconnected tools for project management
- Information is scattered across email, chat, documents, and task boards
- Context switching between applications wastes 5+ hours weekly per team member
- Important details get lost in the shuffle between platforms

### 2. Poor Visibility and Accountability
- Managers lack real-time visibility into project status without interrupting teams
- Team members struggle to track dependencies across multiple projects
- Work duplication occurs due to communication gaps
- Bottlenecks remain hidden until they cause significant delays

### 3. Inefficient Collaboration
- Asynchronous teamwork creates communication bottlenecks
- Document sharing and version control is inconsistent
- Meeting overload compensates for poor asynchronous collaboration
- Information retrieval is time-consuming and often incomplete

## Market Research Findings

Our research with 50+ potential users and 10 in-depth interviews revealed:
- 78% of teams use 4+ different tools for project management
- 64% report spending 5+ hours weekly in "work about work" (status updates, finding info)
- 82% struggle with prioritization across multiple projects
- 71% feel overwhelmed by notification overload
- 68% report delays due to waiting for information or approvals

## User Pain Point Prioritization

1. **Time wasted switching between tools**
   - "I have to have 5-6 tabs open at all times just to do my job"
   - "I spend more time figuring out where information is than actually working"

2. **Difficulty tracking dependencies**
   - "I never know when someone else's work is blocking mine until it's too late"
   - "We have no visibility into dependencies across different projects"

3. **Unclear prioritization**
   - "I never know what I should be working on when I have 20 tasks across 3 projects"
   - "Each project manager thinks their tasks are highest priority"

4. **Information scattered across platforms**
   - "Finding the latest version of a document is like a treasure hunt"
   - "I waste 30+ minutes daily just searching for information"

5. **Notification fatigue**
   - "I get so many notifications that I miss important ones"
   - "I have to turn off notifications to focus, which means I miss urgent updates"
